# Lending Decentralised Application Using TLS-N

A decentralised application based on the Ethereum network allowing users to propose and make custom bets with one another on Premier League football matches. Through the use of the TLS-N protocol, our smart contracts verify the source of data without the need for an Oracle service.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
Nodejs
Ganache
Truffle
Web Browser With Metamask
```

### Installing

In order to install all the dependencies required, run the script 'INSTALL.sh'.

## Running the tests

To run the automated tests in our system you will need to type 'truffle test' in your command line when in the project folder.

## Deployment

A live deployment of this contract can be found on the Rinkeby test network at the following address: [](). A live deployment of our site can be found [here]().
