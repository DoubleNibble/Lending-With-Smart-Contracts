truffle init : turns your folder into a truffle environment
truffle migrate : compiles contracts
truffle migrate --reset : resets the contract deployment

truffle console
Also have access to web3 in truffle console
Can get address of specific contracts using nameOfContract.address
web3.eth.accounts : gives list of all accounts (can also be seen in Ganache)

you can then access instances of your smart contract: Greetings.deployed().then(function(instance){app=instance;})
you can then access methods in your smart contract: app.getGreetings.call()

Checking the state of a contract is free
Change the state of a smart contract: app.setGreetings("Hello Matthew!",{from:web3.eth.accounts[0]})

Exit truffle console: .exit

Ethereum transaction always has four fields:
1) from
2) to
3) value - how much ether should be transferred (can be 0)
4) data or input - either detail about smart contract function, code or nothing if transfer or value


To start a new development enviornment:
1) Start Ganache
2) run geth attach http://localhost:8545 in terminal
3) make sure  you are in your smart contract folder, then run truffle migrate. This deploys the smart contract to your test node.

Debugging:
Try logging in and out of metamask
Try metamask->sidebar->settings->reset accounts


For the betting contract:
- truffle console
- truffle migrate
- Insurance.deployed().then(function(instance){app=instance;})
- Query number of contracts: app.getNumberOfInsuranceContracts()
- app.proposeInsuranceCover("hello",1,{from:'0xC5fdf4076b8F3A5357c5E395ab970B5B54098Fef', value: web3.toWei(0.2, "ether")})
- app.getInsuranceContracts()
- Get balance of contract: web3.fromWei( web3.eth.getBalance('0x23e84570f7b28ad0d5e5545d398009194a8734f3').toNumber(), "ether" )
- To do coverage tests run the following: ./node_modules/.bin/solidity-coverage
